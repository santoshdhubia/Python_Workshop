       "'Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently \"I\\'m a lawyer\" he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often).'"

This is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which Williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.<br /><br />Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until William's character gets close to achieving his goal.<br /><br />I must say that I was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.<br /><br />It rates a 7.7/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.\""

       "['the story begins in the late 1700s where a conniving british officer named clive deceives the honest king mirza and dupes him off his family life and kingdom the young princess zafira is the only one who escapes along with the king’s trusted guard khudabaksh and many years later they form a gang of pirates who are basically a bunch of goodfellas their only mission is to get their kingdom free from clive and his company rule thugs of hindostan is based during the british rule in india when the english used their trading position to dominate india’s princely states but the fact that the heroes of this tale are pirates doesn’t quite fit into the indian context given that indians never gained notoriety as pirates the maratha navy under leaders like kanhoji angre did gain bandit status during the 1700s but thugs of hindostan toh doesn’t quite look like it’s a story emerging from the coastal regions of the country historical inaccuracy aside toh is an adventure movie and you need cinematic liberty to setup a swashbuckling story while the production design by sumit basu and cinematography by manush nandan are excellent the predictable nature of the writing by writer   director vijay krishna acharya doesn’t help the movie at all you can guess every plot development and the fact that the movie doesn’t throw up a single good surprise or twist just rocks the boat the tiresome screenplay features scenes that are too prolonged and overtly dramatised as a result the story hits choppy waters what’s also funny is that the british officers speak in fluent hindi even when theyre talking to each otheranother disappointing aspect of the movie is the music by ajay atul that doesn’t add to the narrative while the individual performances by aamir khan and amitabh bachchan are noteworthy the rest of the cast just never comes together aamir is good with the physical comedy and banter however an aamir khan film generally comes with mammoth expectations so will the disappointment of this movie leave his fans high and dry and impact his brand value only time will tell mr bachchan pulls off the heroics and the intense dialogues well but the rest of the cast isn’t able to rally up any serious effort katrina kaif is limited to two songs and a few lines of dialogue while fatima sana shaikh is left at the mercy of some badly choreographed action sequences']"
